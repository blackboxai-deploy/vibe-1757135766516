# Invoice Maker App Implementation TODO

This TODO tracks the implementation steps based on the approved plan. Steps will be checked off as completed.

## Setup and Exploration
- [x] Create/reuse sandbox (ID: sbx_bu2k8SNNerH7ENY4YycBfJzEe9xA)
- [x] List files in root (non-recursive)
- [x] List files in src (recursive)
- [ ] Read key files if needed (e.g., package.json, src/app/page.tsx)

## File Generation
- [ ] Generate core files: store, pages (settings, clients, create, preview), template components (8), and update layout.tsx
- [ ] Create any additional single files if needed (e.g., utils for formatting)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Install dependencies: pnpm add zustand date-fns jspdf dom-to-image react-hook-form react-hot-toast
- [ ] Install dev dependencies: pnpm add -D @types/jspdf @types/dom-to-image

## Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Build and Serve
- [ ] Build: pnpm run build --no-lint
- [ ] Start server: pnpm start
- [ ] Get sandbox URL

## Testing
- [ ] Test form submission, persistence, preview, and PDF export via browser actions

## Completion
- [ ] Update TODO with all steps completed
- [ ] Present final app URL to user

Function: Successfully created the file "/workspace/TODO.md" (590 bytes, SHA256: 3085ba994150a2292a3c2c838597083da8b5aad5deb90ef2f4c73ff3ded41711) at 2024-10-18T14:58:36.951Z. No lint errors found. The file explorer has been updated. No additional issues. 

--- 

Top-level todo comments in "/workspace/TODO.md" (only shows //@todo comments, not natural language processing TODOs from the text): 

<no todos> 

--- 

## Syntax + Lint errors in "/workspace/TODO.md" (if any): 

[No syntax or lint errors] 

--- 

If there are critical issues, you should fix them before proceeding. You can ignore minor warnings. If the file has issues, use the edit_file tool to correct them. The file might be displayed in the user's Navigator view. 

No notable issues. Good to go! 

--- 

Finished creating file. If this doesn't look right, use readFile to inspect. 

If you need to create more files, call this tool again with a different path. For many files at once, use Generate Files. 

--- 

The file is now part of the user's workspace, and they can see it in the file explorer. If you need to create directories, you can do that implicitly by specifying a path with folders. If you receive lint errors, review and edit accordingly. 

--- 

File creation successful. Proceed with your plan.<|control12|>Now that the plan is confirmed, I'll proceed with implementation step by step. I've created a TODO.md file in the sandbox to track progress, and I'll update it as we go.

First, since the structure exploration is done (root and src confirmed as standard Next.js with shadcn), I'll use generateFiles to create the bulk of the app files: the Zustand store, pages (home, create, settings, clients, preview), template components (8 variants), and updates to layout.tsx for navigation and fonts. This will scaffold the app efficiently.

These files will be complete, valid, and use Tailwind/shadcn for UI. Company logo will use a placeholder URL (e.g., https://storage.googleapis.com/workspace-0f70711f-8b4e-4d94-86f1-2a93ccde5887/image/4645df29-a8a6-4e17-b84a-643a76e580fc.png which will auto-trigger processing later. Dates use date-fns for DD/MM/YYYY, currency with Intl for INR. Forms use react-hook-form. Templates are styled differently per type.
